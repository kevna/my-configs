My arch linux configuration files for openbox, bash, tmux & vim.


An Example of my two line bash prompt can be seen in "terminal-screenshot.png".
The prompt can be read as follows:
user(virtualTerminal:backgroundProcessCount)@hostname[battery]:directory ∓
\-errorCode-historyNumber--
Where the battery value is colour coded:
	bold white - full
	plain cyan - discharging
	plain red  - low (< 1/4)
	flash red  - danger (< 10%)
	bold cyan  - charging
The ∓ flag (git logo) appears when the present working directory is a git repo,
and the error code is replaced with a green tick if 0 (clean exit).

A wealth on information on configuring bashrc can be found on the arch wiki: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Color_Bash_Prompt
